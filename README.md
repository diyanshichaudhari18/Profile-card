# Profile-card
Imagine you're building a website for a portfolio, and you want to have a profile card element that can be configured and reused easily, it's interactive and of course pretty.      
Implement a custom HTML element: Profile card -> &lt;profile-card> &lt;/profile-card>      
Use Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML for your component         
Add tests for the element, you can use selenium or follow a more challenging approach doing unit tests for it.         
What if you wanted it to preserve its own styling among websites?
